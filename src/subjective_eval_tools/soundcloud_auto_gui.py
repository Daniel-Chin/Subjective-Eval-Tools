'''
A tool for batch copying embed html code from soundcloud.  
It controls your keyboard to do that.  
You need the Vimium extension in your browser.  

To copy:  
1. Open your album (list of audios) page in soundcloud.  
2. Press ` in your browser to start the automated GUI sequence.  
2.1. Correction! You need to press Enter in the terminal instead. See comments in code.  
3. Wait for the browser to return to the original state.  
4. Finished. You can now paste.  

To abort during automation: Press `  

Additional notes:  
- This setup is necessary because SoundCloud's embed html of a private song contains a secret token.  
- Recommended workflow: edit the questions in the survey one by one. For each edit, evoke this tool once to copy the next song's embed code.  
- You likely need to modify code around "# modify"  
- An observed issue: sometimes the "Your track isnâ€™t eligible for recommendation yet." banner unpredictably doesn't show, affecting vimium key maps. You'd have to manually do those ones.
